The core objective of this lecture is to introduce copula modelling of hydrological drought at ungauged catchments using proxy data, mainly tree rings and ENSO. It focuses on producing additional stream flow records (for ungauged catchment and poorly gauged catchments) and analysing these data for a frequency analysis of drought. The copula method is explained step by step in the case study area of the Wabi-Shebele river basin in Ethiopia.",

Therefore a brief description including innovations and criticism of the WFD is shown. The last part discusses the implementation of the WFD in Germany including current achievements and deficits.",

Particular attention is drawn towards respective policies in the German federal state of Lower Saxony and, by presenting a comparative study on 19 case studies of participatory water governance, in northern America. The lecture closes by discussing related challenges for conducting participatory processes on the one hand and ‘success factors’ on the other hand, and presents several pertinent guidelines for future planning.",

Part I of this lecture introduces relevant terms including water productivity and controlled deficit irrigation. In the main section of the part, the different types of crop growth models are outlined. Furthermore, it is shown how to setup and evaluate a no-cost crop growth model step by step. The setup model is then used to evaluate three different irrigation strategies and to develop a real-time irrigation schedule. It is demonstrated that crop growth modelling is a powerful tool not only for an evaluation of crop management strategies after harvest (yield gap analysis), but also for real-time crop management.

The reliability of simulation based predictions depends on the quality and quantity of the data used for model calibration and evaluation which can be obtained e.g. in field experiments. Part II of this lecture addresses issues related to an optimal experimental design namely the data collection, instrumentation and the experimental layout. Moreover, the soil hydraulic parameters will be estimated using two no-cost programs based on soil texture data and on data measured with pressure plate extractors. ",

The integrated economic-hydrologic model is demonstrated by a case study in the Olifants catchment in South Africa, where the integrated model is used to determine ‘sustainable’ optimum water allocation among different water uses such as irrigation, mining and domestic purposes. Results of different scenarios for the case study are presented.",

# vi-analytics #

vi-analytics combines a bunch of tools to analyse user behavior and video usage from log files. The library is written for node.js. 
Video usage mining techniques can be applied in order to generate D3.js visualizations 

1. Read logdata from csv. Therefore the csv field need to be manually mapped to the purposes JSON keys. 

2. Data Preparation 

3. Visualize the output as SVG by using D3.js


## Use Cases ##
